# BeatTick

Backend for a ticket sales system, built with Python, FastAPI, and SQLAlchemy, following a feature-based architecture.

## Project Structure

The project follows a feature-based architecture, where each main functionality of the application is located in its own directory within `app/features`.

- **`app/`**: Main application directory.
  - **`main.py`**: Entry point for the FastAPI application.
  - **`core/`**: Core application components.
    - `config.py`: Application configuration (project name, database URL, etc.).
    - `database.py`: Configuration for the SQLite database using SQLAlchemy.
  - **`features/`**: Contains the different features of the application.
    - **`tickets/`**: Feature for managing tickets.
      - `models.py`: Database models (SQLAlchemy).
      - `schemas.py`: Validation schemas (Pydantic).
      - `repository.py`: Data access layer.
      - `services.py`: Business logic.
      - `routes.py`: API endpoints (FastAPI Router).
- **`requirements.txt`**: Project dependencies.

## How to Get Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- pip

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <REPOSITORY_URL>
   cd <DIRECTORY_NAME>
   ```

2. (Optional but recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   # On Windows
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   # On macOS/Linux
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Execution

To start the development server, run the following command from the project root:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

The server will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### API Documentation

Once the server is running, you can access the interactive API documentation (generated by Swagger UI) at:

[http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs)

From there, you can view all available endpoints and test them directly.
